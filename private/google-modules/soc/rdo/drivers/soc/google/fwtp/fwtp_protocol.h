/**
 * DOC: FWTP tracepoint rings
 *
 * FWTP tracepoints are written into and read from ring buffers. New tracepoints
 * are written to the tail of the ring, and the oldest tracepoint is read from
 * the head of the ring. The head and tail of the ring are maintained as byte
 * offsets from the start of the ring.
 *
 * FWTP tracepoint rings are initially filled with empty tracepoints. When a
 * tracepoint producer adds new tracepoints to the ring, they will overwrite the
 * oldest entry.
 *
 * FWTP rings have one tail offset, but may have multiple head offsets. Each
 * consumer of tracepoints has its own ring head offset. Since the producer
 * overwrites the oldest entry, it doesn't need to keep track of any head
 * offsets.
 *
 * If a consumer does not read from a ring often enough, the tail offset could
 * wrap around the ring and past the consumer's head offset, overrunning
 * tracepoints that the consumer has not yet read. The consumer must be able to
 * detect this condition.
 *
 * To detect overruns, FWTP uses the head and tail offsets. When the head and
 * tail offsets reach the end of the ring buffer, instead of being wrapped
 * around back to zero, they continue to be incremented. If the difference
 * between the tail and head offsets is larger than the size of the ring buffer,
 * then an overrun has occurred.
 *
 * When computing the location in the ring buffer of given a head or tail
 * offset, FWTP uses the offset modulo the size of the ring buffer.
 *
 * Information about a tracepoint ring may be obtained by using
 * &struct fwtp_msg_get_ring_info messages of type
 * &fwtp_msg_type.kFwtpMsgTypeGetRingInfo. The ring information to get is
 * specified by &fwtp_msg_get_ring_info.ring_num.
 *
 * Tracepoints may be read using &struct fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints messages of
 * type &fwtp_msg_type.kFwtpMsgTypeGetTracepoints. The ring to read from is
 * specified by &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.ring_num, and the consumer's head
 * offset is specified by the &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.head_offset field.
 *
 * In the response, the read tracepoint data will be set in the
 * &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.tracepoints field, and the size of the data will be
 * specified in the &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.tracepoints_size field. In
 * addition, the head offset of the next unread tracepoint will be specified in
 * the &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.head_offset field, and the current tail offset
 * is returned in the &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.tail_offset field.
 *
 * If &fwtp_msg_get_tracepoints.timestamp_hz is non-zero, it specifies the
 * frequency of the timestamps in Hz. This may be used to convert the tracepoint
 * timestamps to seconds.
 *
 * An overrun may be detected by comparing the returned tracepoints size with
 * the difference between the ending and starting head offsets. If the
 * difference is larger than the returned tracepoints size, an overrun has
 * occurred and some tracepoints have been lost.
