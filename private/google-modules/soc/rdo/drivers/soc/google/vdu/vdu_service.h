/*
 * SERVICE_ID: GDMC_MBA_SERVICE_ID_VDU
 *
 * This message is used to communicate with BMSM core to use Volatile Debug Unlock (VDU)
 *
 * The TYPE field in the header determines type of operation to be executed against BMSM.
 * Each operation has a different interpretation for remaining mailbox message payload.
 *
 * ==================================================
 * ===== TYPE: GDMC_MBA_VDU_RETRIEVE_NONCE ==========
 * ==================================================
 *
 * This operation is used to trigger gRoot nonce generation for VDU, or read existing one from the
 * cache in GDMC.
 *
 * Request:
 * AP must pass physical address and available size of the buffer where nonce & chip-id should be
 * stored.
 * NOTE: Buffer must have size of at least sizeof(struct gdmc_mba_vdu_msg_nonce_buffer).
 * NOTE: It is recommended to use `struct gdmc_mba_vdu_msg_nonce_buffer` in the caller code.
 * NOTE: Buffer must be placed in the first gigabyte of DRAM (SoC range: 0x80000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF)
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: Bits 31-0 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 2: Bits 63-32 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 3: Buffer size
 *
 * Response:
 * GDMC triggers "generate nonce" request to gRoot and stores the result in the internal GDMC cache.
 * If nonce has been already generated, existing value from the internal GDMC cache will be used.
 *
 * Nonce and chip-id values are placed in the buffer one after another.
 * |       Buffer       |
 * |  nonce  |  chipid  |
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data (unchanged)
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: (unchanged)
 * Word 2: (unchanged)
 * Word 3: (unchanged)
 *
 * ==================================================
 * ===== TYPE: GDMC_MBA_VDU_PROCESS_DIRECTIVE =======
 * ==================================================
 *
 * This operation is used to send VDU directive to gRoot.
 *
 * Request:
 * AP must pass physical SoC address of the buffer where VDU directive is stored and size of
 * grant/directive components.
 * NOTE: Buffer must be placed in the first gigabyte of DRAM (SoC range: 0x80000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF)
 *
 * VDU directive consists of two components (grant and delegate) which are expected to be placed
 * one after another in the buffer
 * |        Buffer        |
 * |  grant  |  delegate  |
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: Bits 31-0 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 2: Bits 63-32 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 3: Size of grant and directive components in the buffer
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15 - 0     ]
 *      | delegate_size | grant_size ]
 *
 * Response:
 * GDMC passes provided VDU directive to gRoot to process and returns status code.
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data (unchanged)
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: (unchanged)
 * Word 2: (unchanged)
 * Word 3: (unchanged)
 *
 * ==================================================
 * ===== TYPE: GDMC_MBA_VDU_GET_TIMER =======
 * ==================================================
 *
 * This operation is used to read GROOT_TIMER register and parse it.
 *
 * Request:
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: (reserved)
 * Word 2: (reserved)
 * Word 3: (reserved)
 *
 * Response:
 * GDMC reads GROOT_TIMER register from BMSM, parses it and provides result in mailbox response
 * payload.
 *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data (unchanged)
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: Status of VDU enablement (1 - enabled, 0 - disabled)
 * Word 2: Remaining minutes of VDU enablement
 * Word 3: (reserved)
 *
 * ==================================================
 * ===== TYPE: GDMC_MBA_VDU_GET_VECTOR =======
 * ==================================================
 *
 * This operation is used to read DTA_AUTH_VECTOR registers.
 *
 * Request:
 * AP must pass physical SoC address of the buffer where result will be stored.
 * NOTE: Buffer must have size of at least sizeof(gdmc_mba_vdu_msg_vector_buffer).
 * NOTE: It is recommended to use `gdmc_mba_vdu_msg_vector_buffer` in the caller code.
 * NOTE: Buffer must be placed in the first gigabyte of DRAM (SoC range: 0x80000000 - 0xBFFFFFFF *
 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
 *      | common header | TYPE   |
 * Word 1: Bits 31-0 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 2: Bits 63-32 of SOC physical address of the buffer
 * Word 3: Available buffer size
 *
 * Response:
 * GDMC reads DTA_AUTH_VECTOR registers from BMSM, and stores result in the provided buffer.

 * Word 0: Non-queue mode header and data (unchanged)
 *  bit [ 31 - 16       | 15-0     ]
